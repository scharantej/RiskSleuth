 ## Flask Application Design for Finding Risks Relevant to Google on the Internet

### HTML Files

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the user interface for the application.
- It will contain a form with an input field for the user to enter a search term (e.g., "Google") and a submit button.

**2. results.html**
- This HTML file will display the results of the search, including a list of relevant risks and their descriptions.
- It will be rendered when the user submits the search form on the index.html page.

### Routes

**1. @app.route('/')**
- This route will handle the GET request for the index.html page.
- It will render the index.html file, displaying the search form to the user.

**2. @app.route('/search', methods=['POST'])**
- This route will handle the POST request submitted from the search form on the index.html page.
- It will extract the search term from the request data and use it to perform a web search for relevant risks.
- The results of the search will be rendered in the results.html file, which will then be displayed to the user.

### Additional Notes

- The application will use the Python Requests library to perform the web search for risks.
- The application will store the search results in a temporary data structure (e.g., a list or dictionary) and pass it to the results.html file for rendering.
- The application can be further enhanced by adding features such as pagination for the search results, filtering options, or a more sophisticated search algorithm.
